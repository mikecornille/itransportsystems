<h3>Helping with check calls</h3>

<p>Please take a look at the To Be Loaded and To Be Delivered pages.  Check to see if any shipments you're concerned about are not getting appropiate updates.  If you find one, politely bring it up to Wanda or the Rate Con creator.  Of course, if they're swamped make the call for fastest results.</p>
